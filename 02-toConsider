    Module testsVersteeg includes functions report_aPWEb(c,v) and
    report_y(x,yc,yv,ya) to pretty-print reports on the coefficients and on the
    solution. Shoud these functions be moved to module aux?
    In favor: these are auxiliary functions, makes sense to move them
    Against:  these functions are specific to the Versteeg tests.
    Decision: Better write more general report functions in module aux. If they
        can be made usable for the Versteeg tests, even better.
